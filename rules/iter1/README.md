Applying single rules, iteration \#1
====================================

In this iteration [single rules](../rules.txt) are applied to entropy 
inequalities in [base](base.txt). The MOLP problems and their
solutions are in [vlp](vlp). New inequalities
are extraced to the files [result](result)/NN.new.
Finally, the minimal set of all generated inequalities is collected into
[it1](it1.txt).

#### Contents

* [base](base.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; base file of inequalities, truncated
  [generated by copy strings](../../copy/ineq.txt)
* [it1](it1.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; new inequalities generated by single rules
* [result](result) &nbsp;&ndash; new inequalities by individual rules
* [vlp](vlp) &nbsp;&ndash; MOLP problems and their solutions
