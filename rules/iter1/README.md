Applying single rules, iteration \#1
====================================

In this iteration [single rules](../rules.txt) are applied to entropy 
inequalities in [base200.txt](base200.txt). The MOLP problems and their
solutions are in [vlp](vlp). New inequalities not superseded by those in 
[ineq.txt](ineq.txt) are extraced to the files [result](result)/NN.new.
Finally, the minimal set of inequalities is generated into
[it1.txt](it1.txt).

#### Contents

* [base200.txt](base200.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; the base file of inequalities 
  truncated from [ineq.txt](ineq.txt) to coefficients below 200
* [ineq.txt](ineq.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; the base file of inequalities,
  identical to the one [generated by copy strings](../../copy/ineq.txt)
* [it1.txt](it1.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; new inequalities generated by all rules
* [result](result) &nbsp;&ndash; new inequalities generated by the rules
* [vlp](vlp) &nbsp;&ndash; the MOLP problems and their solutions
