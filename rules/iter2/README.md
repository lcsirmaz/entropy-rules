Applying single rules, iteration \#2
====================================

In this iteration [single rules](../rules.txt) are applied to entropy 
inequalities in [base100](base100.txt). The MOLP problems and their
solutions are in [vlp](vlp). New inequalities not superseded by those in 
[ineq](ineq.txt) are extraced to the files [result](result)/NN.new.
Finally, all minimal set of inequalities is collected into
[it2](it2.txt).

#### Contents

* [base100](base100.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; the base file of inequalities 
  truncated from [ineq.txt](ineq.txt) to coefficients below 100
* [ineq](ineq.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; the base file of inequalities,
  identical to the one [generated by iteration 1](../../iter1/it1.txt)
* [it2](it2.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; new inequalities generated by all rules
* [result](result) &nbsp;&ndash; new inequalities generated by the rules
individually
* [vlp](vlp) &nbsp;&ndash; the MOLP problems and their solutions
