Applying single rules, iteration \#5
====================================

In this iteration [single rules](../rules.txt) 02, 05, 20, 21, 22 and
21 are applied to entropy inequalities in [base35](base35.txt); these are
the rules which appear in the list [ineq](ineq.txt). ../../ineqs/r04-d05.txt)
of inequalities generated earlier. The MOLP problems and their
solutions are in [vlp](vlp). New inequalities not superseded by those in 
[ineq](ineq.txt) are extraced to the files [result](result)/NN.new.
Finally, the minimal set of all generated inequalities is collected into
[it5](it5.txt).

#### Contents

* [base35](base35.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; the base file of inequalities 
  truncated from [ineq](ineq.txt) to coefficients below 35
* [ineq](ineq.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; the base file of inequalities,
  identical to the one [generated earlier](../../ineqs/r04-d05.txt).
* [it5](it5.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; new inequalities generated by these rules
* [result](result) &nbsp;&ndash; new inequalities generated by individual rules
* [vlp](vlp) &nbsp;&ndash; MOLP problems and their solutions
