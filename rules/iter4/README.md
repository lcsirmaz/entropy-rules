Applying single rules, iteration \#3
====================================

In this iteration [single rules](../rules.txt) are applied to entropy 
inequalities in [base40](base40.txt). The MOLP problems and their
solutions are in [vlp](vlp). New inequalities not superseded by those in 
[ineq](ineq.txt) are extraced to the files [result](result)/NN.new.
Finally, the minimal set of all generated inequalities is collected into
[it3](it3.txt).

#### Contents

* [base40](base40.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; the base file of inequalities 
  truncated from [ineq](ineq.txt) to coefficients below 40
* [ineq](ineq.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; the base file of inequalities,
  identical to the one [generated by iteration #3](../../iter3/it3.txt)
* [it4](it4.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; new inequalities generated by all single rules
* [result](result) &nbsp;&ndash; new inequalities generated by individual rules
* [vlp](vlp) &nbsp;&ndash; MOLP problems and their solutions
