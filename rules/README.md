New entropy inequalities by rules
=================================

Rules for generating new entropy inequalities were proposed in 
[Dougherty et al](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.3602v1). Rules are a general
method to generate new 4-variable entropy inequalities from other known
ones. Here we consider *single* rules only extending the list of the cited
work. Rules are applied iteratively to a truncated list of known entropy
inequalities; starting with those generated by all copy strings.

#### Not processed

Determining a rule set from its description requires solving a 22-dimensional
MOLP problem. Due to the complexity, rules \#7 and \#39 are not processed yet.
