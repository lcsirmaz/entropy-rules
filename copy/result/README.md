New inequalities from copy strings
==================================

The file xx.new contains new entropy inequalities yielded by the copy string
numbered xx as described in [copy.txt](../copy.txt). Only those inequalities
are liste which are not superseded by the [DFZ](../../DFZ/orig.txt)
inequalities or by the BOOK inequalities.

Each line in xxx.new has the form

> &lt;natural coefficients&gt;, &lt;copy string&gt;, copy:xxx:&lt;label&gt;

where the &lt;label&gt; is the serial
number of the inequality within all inequalities generated by the copy
string numbered xxx.
