Entropy inequalities by copy strings
=====================================

This is a collection of four-variable entropy inequalities generated by
*copy strings*, extending the work of
[R. Dougherty, C. Freiling and K. Zeger](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.3602v1).

#### Limitations

Only copy strings using at most six auxiliary variables are considered. The
strings were chosen mainly by guessing work and not by any method exhausting
all possibilities. Copy strings with more than six auxiliary variables seem
to be beyond the capabilities of the technique applied here.
