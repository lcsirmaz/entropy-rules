Entropy inequalities by copy strings
=====================================

This is a collection of four-variable entropy inequalities generated by
*copy strings*, extending the work of
[R. Dougherty, C. Freiling and K. Zeger](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.3602v1).

#### Limitations

Only copy strings using at most six auxiliary variables are considered. The
strings were chosen mainly by guessing work and not by any method exhausting
all possibilities.

#### Your contribution

If you want a copy string be named after you, propose one which
* has at most six auxiliary variables,
* is not a consequence of inequalities listed here,
* and has small (up to 10) coefficients.
Inequalities which have non-zero coefficients at the last two coordinates
are especially welcome.
