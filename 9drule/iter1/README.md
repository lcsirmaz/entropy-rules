Scaled down double rules, iteration \#1
====================================

In this iteration [scaled down double rules](../drules.txt) are applied to 
entropy inequalities generated at the [latest
iterations](../../ineqs/r04-d04.txt). The MOLP problems and their
solutions are in [vlp](vlp). New inequalities 
are extraced to the files [result](result)/NN.new.
Finally, the minimal set with all newly generated inequalities is collected into
[it1](it1.txt).

#### Contents

* [ineq](ineq.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; base inequalities, extracted from the
  [latest set](../../ineqs/r04-d04.txt) which were added at the last step
* [it1](it1.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; new inequalities generated by all of these rules
* [result](result) &nbsp;&ndash; new inequalities generated by individual rules
* [vlp](vlp) &nbsp;&ndash; MOLP problems and their solutions
