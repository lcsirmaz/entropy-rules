Scaled down double rules, iteration \#2
====================================

In this iteration [scaled down double rules](../drules.txt) are applied to 
entropy inequalities generated at the [previous
iteration](../iter1/it1.txt). The MOLP problems and their
solutions are in [vlp](vlp). New inequalities 
are extraced to the files [result](result)/NN.new.
Finally, the minimal set with all newly generated inequalities is collected into
[it1](it1.txt).

#### Incomplete results

Due to numerical instability, the following problems were aborted, and only
partial results have been used: 02, 04, 12, 14, 16, 18, 33, 35.
