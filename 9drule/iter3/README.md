Scaled down double rules, iteration \#3
====================================

In this iteration [scaled down double rules](../drules.txt) are applied to 
[latest](../../ineqs/r05-d05.txt) entropy inequalities chopped at 30 first,
then chopped at 19 when the solver failed. Rule \#18 was left out as the
solver failed even for the second set of inequalities.
The final MOLP problems and their solutions are in [vlp](vlp). New inequalities
are extraced to the files [result](result)/NN.new.
Finally, the minimal set with all newly generated inequalities is collected into
[it3](it3.txt).

* [base30](base30.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; base inequalities chopped at 30
* [base19](base19.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; base inequalities chopped at 19
* [it3](it3.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; new inequalities
* [result](result) &nbsp;&ndash; new inequalities generated by individual rules
* [vlp](vlp) &nbsp;&ndash; MOLP problems and their solutions
