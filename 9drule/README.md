Entropy inequalities using scaled down double rules
=========================================

About one half of [rules](../rules/DESCRIPTION.md) described in
[Dougherty et al](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.3602v1) uses two bases rather
than a single one. Similarly to the single rules, the general form of these
*double rules* can be found by solving a MOLP problem. These general forms
are reported here for entropy inequalities where the last two coefficients
(corresponding to (c,d) and (a,b | cd) ) are zero.
