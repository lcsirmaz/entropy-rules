Entropy inequalities using scaled down double rules
=========================================

About one half of [rules](../rules/DESCRIPTION.md) described in
[Dougherty et al](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.3602v1) uses two bases rather
than a single one. Similarly to the single rulesets, the complete
*double ruleset* can be found by solving a MOLP problem. Complete
rulesets are reported here for &quot;scaled down&quot; entropy inequalities
meaning that the last two coefficients in the inequality is assumed to be zero.
(No 4-variable inequality violating this assumption was found so far, this
is one of the big challenges.) For some original rules unabridged rulesets
are reported in the [DFZ](DFZ) directory.
