Dougherty - Freiling - Zeger inequalities
=================

The inequalities from *R. Dougherty, C. 
Freiling, and K.  Zeger:* [Non-Shannon information inequalities in four
random variables](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.3602v1) are
listed in `main.txt` following their original numbering from 1 to 214. 
The [Zhang-Yeung inequality](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs783/2007fa/papers/ZYnonShannon.pdf)
has been added as inequality number 0. Inequalities are rewritten using natural
coordinates, and the reported *copy string* has been normalized with `utils/simp.pl`

DFZ inequalities "superseded" by other inequalities listed in
[main.txt](main.txt) are marked by a * symbol.

#### Content

* [main.txt](main.txt) &nbsp;&ndash;  the list of DFZ inequalities.
* [orig.txt](orig.txt) &nbsp;&ndash;  raw file of DFZ inequalities from which `main.txt` is generated automatically.
* [vlp](vlp) &nbsp;&ndash; MOLP problems and solutions associated with DFZ inequality number `xxx`. `vlp/xxx.vlp` is generated by `utils/mkvlp.pl`; `vlp/xxx.out`, and `vlp/xxx.res` contain the output and the solution.
