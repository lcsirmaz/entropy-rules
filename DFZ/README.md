Dougherty - Freiling - Zeger inequalities
=================

The inequalities from *R. Dougherty, C. 
Freiling, and K.  Zeger:* [Non-Shannon information inequalities in four
random variables](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.3602v1) are
listed in `main.txt` following their original numbering from 1 to 214. 
Additionally, the [Zhang-Yeung
inequality](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs783/2007fa/papers/ZYnonShannon.pdf)
is added as inequality number 0. The inequalities are rewritten using natural
coordinates, and the reported *copy string* has been normalized.

DFZ inequalities "superseded" by other inequalities listed in the main
list of this site are marked by a * symbol.

#### Content

* main.txt &nbsp;&ndash;  the list of DFZ inequalities.
* DFZ.txt &nbsp;&ndash;  raw file of DFZ inequalities from which `main.txt` is generated automatically.
* directory vlp &nbsp;&ndash; the MOLP problem associated with DFZ inequality number `xxx` is `vlp/xxx.vlp` as generated by `utils/mkvlp.pl`. Files `vlp/xxx.out`, and `vlp/xxx.res` contain the output and the solution of the MOLP problem as generated by the MOLP solver [inner](https://github.com/lcsirmaz/inner).
