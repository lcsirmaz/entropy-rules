Entropy inequalities on four variables
=============

Most of known entropy inequalities on four random variables are computer
generated. This site compiles some of those inequalities and provides tools
and other information which allows to check their validity.

There are two main methods to get such an inequality. The *copy method* 
proposed originally by
[Zhang and Yeung](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs783/2007fa/papers/ZYnonShannon.pdf), and the *rule method* suggested
by [R. Dougherty et al](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.3602v1).
