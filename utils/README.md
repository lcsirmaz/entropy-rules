Utility perl routines
=====================

* [checkall.pl](checkall.pl) [-t threshold] \<result\> \<ineq1\> \<ineq2\> ...

List all inequalities from `<result>` which are not consequences of the
inequalities in files `<ineq1>`, ... It the `-t` argument is given,
downgrade new inequalities to have coefficients at most `<threshold>`. The
`<result>` file can be a list of inequalities, or the vertex list generated
by the MOLP solver.

* [DFZgen.pl](DFZgen.pl) [-s suppfile]

Generate the [main.txt](../DFZ/main.txt) file which indicates which of the
original 216 inequalities has been superseded. `suppfile` is generated by
[purge.pl](purge.pl).

* [dorule.pl](dorule.pl) \<ineq\> \<rule.txt\> \<vlp-file\>

Apply `<rule.txt>` (generated by [minrule.pl](minrule.pl)) to the set of
inequalities in `<vlp-file>`, and write the MOLP problem to `<vlp-file>`.

* [downgrade.pl](downgrade.pl) [-t threshold] \<result\> \<ineq1\> \<ineq2\> ...

Similar to [checkall.pl](chekcall.pl), but the `<result>` argument must be
the vertex list produced by the MOLP solver.
    
* [genlist.pl](genlist.pl) [-s suppfile] \<outfile\> \<ineq1\> \<ineq2\> ...

Generates the list of all inequalities in files `<ineq1>`, ... leaving out
those which are marked as superseded in `suppfile`.

* [minrule.pl](minrule.pl) \<result\> \<rule.txt\>

From the vertex list produced by the MOLP solver generates the set of rules
to be written to `<rule.txt>`.

* [mkvlp.pl](mkvlp.pl) \<copy-string\> \<vlp-file\>

Generate the MOLP problem from the `<copy-string>`. New entropy inequalities
can be etracted from the solution by [checkall.pl](checkall.pl).

* [purge.pl](purge.pl) [-s suppfile] \<ineq1\> \<ineq2\> ...

Print out the labels of inequalities which are superseded by others, and are
not in the superseded file `suppfile`.

* [rulemk.pl](rulemk.pl) \<copy-string\> \<base\> \<vlp-file\>

A *simple rule* is defined by a copy string and a base. This utility
generated the MOLP problem whose solution yields the rule set extracted by
[minrule.pl](minrule.pl).

* [simp.pl](simp.pl) \<copy-string\>

Print out the simplified and canonized form of the copy string.
