Minimal set of entropy inequalities
===================================

The lists of 4-variable entropy inequalities reported in
file rXX-dYY.txt are the minimal set composed of

* all copy strings reported in the [copy](../copy) folder
* inequalities created in iteration \#XX using [rules](../rules)
* inequalitied created in iteratin \#YY with the [bootstrap](../drules)
method.

When XX or YY is zero, then no iteration has been applied to that set. For
example, [r00-d00.txt](r00-d00.txt) is generated by copy steps alone.
