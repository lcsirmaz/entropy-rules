Bootstrap method, iteration \#1
====================================

Adding known 4-entropy inequalities next to the Shannon inequalities
for a set of [copy strings](../../copy/DESCRIPTION.md). In this 
iteration inequalities in [base20](base20.txt). The MOLP problems and their
solutions are in [vlp](vlp). New inequalities not superseded by those in 
[ineq](ineq.txt) are extraced to the files [result](result)/NN.new.
Finally, the minimal set of all generated inequalities is collected into
[it1](it1.txt).

#### Contents

* [base20](base20.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; the base file of inequalities 
  truncated from [ineq](ineq.txt) to coefficients below 20
* [ineq](ineq.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; the base file of inequalities,
  identical to the one generated by [rule iteration \#1](../../rules/iter1/it1.txt)
* [it1](it1.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; new inequalities generated by all single  rules
* [result](result) &nbsp;&ndash; new inequalities generated by individual rules
* [vlp](vlp) &nbsp;&ndash; MOLP problems and their solutions
