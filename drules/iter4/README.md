Bootstrap method, iteration \#4
====================================

In this iteration four-variable
inequalities in [base19](base19.txt) are used for some of the copy strings
and bases listed in [drules](../drules.txt).
The MOLP problems and their
solutions are in [vlp](vlp). New inequalities not superseded by those in 
[ineq](ineq.txt) are extraced to the files [result](result)/NN.new.
Finally, the minimal set of all generated inequalities is collected into
[it4](it4.txt).

#### Limitations

Only those instances in [drules](../drules.txt) were processed
which gave new inequalities in iteration \#3.

#### Contents

* [base19](base19.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; the base file of inequalities 
  truncated from [ineq](ineq.txt) to coefficients at most 19
* [ineq](ineq.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; the base file of inequalities,
  identical to the one generated by [rule \#4 and drule \#3](../../ineq/r04-d03.txt)
* [it4](it4.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; new inequalities generated in this iteration
* [result](result) &nbsp;&ndash; new inequalities one by one
* [vlp](vlp) &nbsp;&ndash; MOLP problems and their solutions
