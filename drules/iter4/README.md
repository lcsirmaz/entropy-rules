Bootstrap method, iteration \#4
====================================

Adding known 4-entropy inequalities next to the Shannon inequalities
for a set of [double rules](../drules.txt) as identified by
[Dougherty et al](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.3602v1).
In this 
iteration inequalities in [base19](base19.txt) are used. The MOLP problems and their
solutions are in [vlp](vlp). New inequalities not superseded by those in 
[ineq](ineq.txt) are extraced to the files [result](result)/NN.new.
Finally, the minimal set of all generated inequalities is collected into
[it4](it4.txt).

#### Limitations

Only those problems are considered which gave new inequalities in
iteration \#3.

#### Contents

* [base19](base19.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; the base file of inequalities 
  truncated from [ineq](ineq.txt) to coefficients at most 19
* [ineq](ineq.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; the base file of inequalities,
  identical to the one generated by [rule \#4 and drule \#3](../../ineq/r04-d03.txt)
* [it4](it4.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; new inequalities generated in this iteration
* [result](result) &nbsp;&ndash; new inequalities one by one
* [vlp](vlp) &nbsp;&ndash; MOLP problems and their solutions
