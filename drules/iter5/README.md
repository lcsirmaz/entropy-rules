Bootstrap method, iteration \#5
===============================

In this iteration a small set of four-variable inequalities in 
[base](base.txt) are used for some promising 
[copy strings and base sets](rules.txt).

#### Contents

* [base](base.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; base file of inequalities, a really small
  set where the normalized sum of coefficients is at most four
* [rules](rules.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; copy strings and bases
* [it5](it5.txt) &nbsp;&ndash; new inequalities generated in this iteration
* [result](result) &nbsp;&nbsp; new inequalities one by one
* [vlp](vlp) &nbsp;&ndash; MOLP problems and their solutions
