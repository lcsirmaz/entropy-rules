Bootstrap case \#2
==================

Apply 4-variable inequalities from [base30](base30.txt) for two tuplets 
of variables: *ar, br, cr, d* and *ar, br, c, dr*.

* \#00: copy string: *r*=*c*:*ab*, inequalities are applied additionally to *a, b, c, d*
* \#01: copy string: *r*=*c*:*ab*, inequalities are applied additionally to *a, b, c, d*
* \#1 - \#205: the DFZ copy string as listed in [copy](copy.txt),
inequalities are applied to the tuplets *ar, br, cr, d* and *ar, br, c dr*.
