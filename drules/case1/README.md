Bootstrap case \#1
==================

Apply known 4-variable inequalities for variables *a, b, c, d* for the
simplest copy strings *r*=*c*:*ab* and *r*=*a*:*bc*.

* \#0: copy string: *r*=*c*:*ab*, inequalities from [base30](base30.txt)
* \#1: copy string: *r*=*c*:*ab*, inequalities from
  [base30-1](base30-1.txt), extended by new inequalities from \#0
* \#10: copy string: *r*==*a*:*bc*, inequalities from
  [base30-1](base30-1.txt).
